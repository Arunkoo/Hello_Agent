# Hello Agent – Mini CLI (LLM Integration)

## 📌 Overview

**Hello Agent** is a simple CLI-based project built using **TypeScript** as my **first step in the LLM journey**.  
This project demonstrates a basic understanding of how to **connect and interact with multiple Large Language Models (LLMs)** using **direct POST API calls**, without installing or relying on any LLM SDKs or packages.

The focus is on learning core concepts rather than abstraction.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 Integrates with **multiple LLM providers**
- 🔗 Uses **direct HTTP POST URLs** (no SDKs)
- 💻 CLI-based interaction
- 📄 Clean and minimal implementation
- 🎯 Focused on understanding LLM fundamentals

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **API Communication:** Native HTTP / fetch POST requests
- **LLM Integration:** Direct API calls (no external LLM libraries)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters a prompt via the CLI
2. The app sends the prompt to a selected LLM using an HTTP POST request
3. The LLM processes the request
4. The response is displayed directly in the terminal

This approach helps in understanding how LLM SDKs work under the hood.
